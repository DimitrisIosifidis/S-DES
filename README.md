# S-DES
Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES)

This project was done in the course of Computer and Network Security.
The project was to write an algorithm for Simplified Data Encryption Standard following some specific guidelines as shown below.

Guidlines:

Encryption Process:
Input of the simple message by the user in either binary or decimal (8-bit) format.
Input of the encryption key (10-bit) by the user either in binary or in decimal form.
Encrypt the plain message and display the cipher (8-bit) in either binary or decimal format.

Decryption process:
Input of the cipher by the user either in binary or in decimal (8-bit) format.
Input of the encryption key (10-bit) by the user either in binary or in decimal form.
Decrypting the cipher and displaying the plain message (8-bit) in either binary or decimal format.

Bruteforce Attack:
Insert an original message (8-bit) and an encrypted message (8-bit) from the user in either binary or decimal format.
Bruteforce attack to the encryption key and display it (10-bit). If there is more than one encryption key, display all of them.
Extraction of the average time of successful search in N attempts, N>10.

The program was written in Python.
